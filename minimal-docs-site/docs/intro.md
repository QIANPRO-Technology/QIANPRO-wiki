# Getting Started

Welcome to the QIANPRO Docs Template! This is a minimal Docusaurus example that helps you spin up a documentation site quickly.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to verify the site and start editing content under `docs/`, `blog/`, and `src/pages/`.

## First Deployment (Summary)

1. Install Node.js 18 or 20 on the target server.
2. Clone the repository and move into `minimal-docs-site`.
3. Run `npm ci && npm run build` to produce the `build/` output.
4. Use the sample Nginx configuration in `deploy/nginx.conf`.

For the detailed workflow, refer to the wiki pages in the repository root.
